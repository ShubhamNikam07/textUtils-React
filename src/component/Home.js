      <h4>As you can see it is Single Page Application</h4>
        A Single Page Application (SPA) is a website or web application that<br/>
        dynamically rewrites an existing web page with new information from <br/>
        the web server. In a React application, components retrieve site content <br/>
        and render it to a single HTML file in your project.
    
      </div>
    </div>
  );
